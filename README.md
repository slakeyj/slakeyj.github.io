**About Me**

I've worked and volunteered in animal rescue for six years working specifically with cats.  I've lived in Seattle for nine years and recently moved to a new home in Ballard with my husband and our 3 cats.  Though I'm still passionate about animal rescue, I'm excited to start a new chapter in my life and learn how to program at Code Fellows.
