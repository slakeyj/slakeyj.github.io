**About Me**

I've worked and volunteered in animal rescue for six years working specifically with cats.  I've lived in Seattle for nine years and recently moved to a new home in Ballard with my husband and our 3 cats.  Though I'm still passionate about animal rescue, I'm excited to start a new chapter in my life and learn how to program at Code Fellows.

**What is a Growth Mindset**

A growth mindset is one that is accepting of challenges and mistakes.  Challenges are *embraced* rather than avoided.

#### Reminders to myself on how to keep myself on a growth mindset:
- Don't ignore criticism, but learn from it.
- Don't view others successes as a threat.  Be inspired by them.
- Don't lose focus when obstacles come your way.  Persist through them.
