### Learning Javascript
- A **script** is a series of instruction that a computer can follow.

  - Each instruction is a **statement**. All statements end with a semicolon.

- A **code block** is indicated by an opening and closing curly brace.

- Comments are useful to help explain what your code does.  

- **Variables** are used to to help remember information. Declaring a variable looks like the following:

  >var number = 5;

- **var** is the keyword used to create a variable.

- number is the name or identifier of the variable.

- **=** is the assignment operator used to assign 5 to the variable called number.


- There are 3 **Data Types**:

  1. **Numeric Data Type**: handles all numbers.

  2. **String Data Type**: consists of letters and characters and is enclosed in a pair of quotes.

  3. **Boolean Data Type**: can only have the value of true or false.

- To have quotes appear within a string you must use an escape character. This is done by using a backwards slash before any quote that will appear within your string.

- **Rules for Naming a Variable**

  1. It must begin with a letter, dollar sign, or an underscore.  It cannot start with a number

  2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign, or an underscore.  You cannot use a dash or a period.

  3. You cannot use keywords or reserved words.

  4. Variables are case sensitive.

  5. Use a name that describes the kind of information being stored in the variable.

  6. If your variable is made up of more than one word, use Camel Casing.  For example myName or newNumber.
