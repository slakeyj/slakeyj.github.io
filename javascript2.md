### Introduction to Javascript

- Javascript helps you to make webpages more interactive.  It does this by:

  1. Accessing content
  2. Modifying content
  3. With Program Rules
  4. Reacting to Events

- A script is a series of instructions a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

- To write a script, you sshould break it down into smaller steps:

  1. Define the Goal.  What are you trying to achieve?
  2. Design the Script. Split the goal into a series of tasks.
  3. Code Each Step. Each step needs to written in a programming language that the computer understands.

- It's important to learn how to think like a computer. Computers solve problems **programmatically**.  In other words, they follow a series of instructions, one after the other.

- **Expressions** evaluate into a single value. There are two types:

  - Expressions that assign a value to just a variable.
    >var number = 2;

  - Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value.
    >var multiply = 5 *2;

- **Functions** allow you to group a series of statments together to accomplish a specific task.

  - When naming your function, it should describe the task you're trying to accomplish.

  - **Calling** the function is when you ask it to perform its task.

  - **Parameters** are the pieces of information handed to a function.

  - **Return Value** is the answer the function provides.

  - **Function Declaration** is how you create a function.  Give it a name and then, inside of curly braces, write the statements that you need to achieve the task.
