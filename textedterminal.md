## Choosing a Text Editor
 When a developer chooses what text editor is best for them, there are several things which should be considered:
 * Does it have code completion?
 
    * Some code editors have the ability to give prompts to choose a keyword based on what you've already typed.  They can also automatically add a closing tag to match your opening tags.
 
 * Does it offer syntax highlighting?
    
     * Syntax highlighting is an ability many text editors have to give different items of your code it's own unique color. For example, the color for an element will be different from that of an attribute.
