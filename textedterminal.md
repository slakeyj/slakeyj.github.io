## Choosing a Text Editor
 When a developer chooses what text editor is best for them, there are several things which should be considered:
 * Does it have code completion?
 
    * Some code editors have the ability to give prompts to choose a keyword based on what you've already typed.  They can also automatically add a closing tag to match your opening tags.
 
 * Does it offer syntax highlighting?
    
     * Syntax highlighting is an ability many text editors have to give different items of your code it's own unique color. For example, the color for an element will be different from that of an attribute. This ability makes it easier to quickly see where your code is and whether they are working as intended.
     
* Does it offer a variety of themes?
    
    * As a software developer it's important to take eye strain into consideration.  Themes with a dark background are popular because they help to reduce eye strain.
    
* Does it have a good selection of extensions?
 
   * As you become more proficient in software development, you may find that there are different things you would like to be able to do within your text editor.  This can be made possible through different extensions offered by your editor.  
   
   
Though many operating systems come with text editors already installed on them, I wouldn't reccomend them.  They don't typically have any of the abilities mentioned in the list above and may cause you to more pain than if you were to use a more specialized text editor.
