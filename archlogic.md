### Computer Architecture & Logic

- 4 things common to all computers:

  1. Input
  2. Storage
  3. Processing
  4. Output

- Computers wor on ones and zeroes

- Inside a computer are electric wires and circuits that carry all the information in a computer.

- With one wire we can represent on/off, true/false, 1/0, etc.  This is known as a bit.  The more bits we have, the more complex information we can have.

- In the Binary number system we only have 0 and 1 to count with.  But it can represent any number.

- Circuits are used to modify & process information represented in binary.

- Smaller circuits are faster because they have less distance to travel.

- Central Processing Unit (CPU)

  - The master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer.

  - It has smaller, simpler parts that handle specific tasks.

- Software

  - Tells the CPU what to do

- Operating System

  - The master program that manages software.
