### Design, Structure, and Layout
- When first creating a new website, it's important to consider who your target audience is.

- Determine what is needed to meet their goals and use this to organize your information. This can be used to help you create a site map.

- A Site Map is a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure your site.

- Wireframes are a sketch up of the key information that will be needed on each page of the site.

- HTML 5 introduces new layout elements.  

  - Many help indicate the kind of contain you will find in them.  For example, 
  &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;.

  - &lt;article&gt; is a container for any section of a page that could stand alone.

  - &lt;section&gt; groups related content together.

- Other useful markup:
  - &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; indicates that the page is written in HTML5.

  - &lt;!-- comments here --&gt;
    - Comments are useful in helping others to understand your code.
    - They can be used to block off sections of code you don't want to be rendered.

  - ID attribute
    - Uniquely identifies that element from others.
    - No two elements on the same page should have the same value for their id attribute.
    - Allows you to style that element differently from any other on the page.

  - Class attribute
    - Every HTML element can carry a class attribute.
    - Can be used on several elements to change them in the same way.

  - &lt;meta&gt;
    - Resides inside of &lt;head&gt;.
    - Contains information about the webpage.

  - Escape characters
    - Some characters are reserved for HTML code and require escape characters for them to appear on your page.
    - Some examples:
      - ```&lt;``` gives you &lt;
      - ```&amp``` gives you &amp;
      - ```&copy;``` gives you &copy;
