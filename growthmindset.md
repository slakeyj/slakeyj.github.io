### What is a Growth Mindset

A growth mindset is one that is accepting of challenges and mistakes.  Challenges are *embraced* rather than avoided.

#### Reminders to myself on how to keep myself on a growth mindset:
- Don't ignore criticism, but learn from it.
- Don't view others successes as a threat.  Be inspired by them.
- Don't lose focus when obstacles come your way.  Persist through them.
